# CompConv
 Computer Conversions. Made in C++. Expect updates.

 Overview:
 CompConv is a program that allows you to convert numbers into things that
 are helpful for using a computer. The program contains Binary, Hexadecimal,
 ASCII, and more computer relevent conversions. A useful feature about the
 program is that whenever you make a conversion, it will walk you through
 each individual step on how to make your conversion manually if you didn't
 have a conversion program like CompConv at hand. More necessary conversions
 will come in the future.

 Editing and Permitted Use:
 If you would like to use this program, you may download the Windows Executable
 files. If you would like to edit or touch up code, you may also take the code
 included in the files of this repository and edit them. Please don't re-post
 the same code.
